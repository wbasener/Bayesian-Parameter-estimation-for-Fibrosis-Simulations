# Fibrosis-Simulations](https://github.com/wbasener/Bayesian-Parameter-estimation-for-Fibrosis-Simulations
Bayesian estimation of probability distributions for parameters in IPF models using NetLogo.

This code requires NetLogo (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) is installed. It is compatable with version 6.2.1.

x0 = coefficient for collagen deposition

x1 = coefficient for collagen degradation

x2 = transiion threshold (between THY1+ and THY1-)
